# PyBer_Analysis

### Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
Using my Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, I’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, I’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.


### Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)
Per the summary below: 

Highest:
* Total Rides - Urban
* Total Drivers - Urban
* Total Fares - Urban
* Average Fare per Ride - Rural
* Average Fare per Driver - Rural

Lowest:
* Total Rides - Rural
* Total Drivers - Rural
* Total Fares - Rural
* Average Fare per Ride - Urban
* Average Fare per Driver - Urban
